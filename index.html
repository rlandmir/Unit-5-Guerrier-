    <h1>Text Formatting</h1>
    <p>There are three types of text formatting. Those are: <b>bold</b>, <i>italics</i>, and <u>underline</u>.</p>

    <h2>Inline vs. Block Element</h2>
    <p> <b> Block element</b> moves the content to a new line. The paragraph and headers elements are block elements. An <b>inline element</b> keeps its content on the same line as the content before and after it. It does not creat a new line. The bold, italics and underline element are inline element </p>

    <h3><u>Block Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph.</p><p>This is another paragraph. It makes a new block.</p>
    <p>This is an example of a nested block element.<P>This is a nested block</P></p>

    <h3><u>Inline Elements Example</u></h3>
    <p>This is a paragraph with <b>an inline element</b>. Notice how the inline element does not move to a new line</p>

    <h2>Vertical Spacing</h2>
    <p>There are two elements that help with vertical spacing between block elements. A <b>line break</b>moves the content down to a new line. Its similar to the<i>Enter</i> key word/Docs. A <b>horizontal rule</b> is a line break which includes a horizontal bar across the page. Both are block elements.</p>

    <p>Below this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Above this paragraph is a line break.</p>
    <p>Below this paragraph is a horizontal rule.</p>
